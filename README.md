### TODO:

- Restructure:
    - `reginald_codegen`: CLI + Code generators
    - `reginald`: Traits
    - Future:
        - `reginald_derive`: Packed struct derive macros
        - `reginald_gui`: GUI Tool

- Derive:
    - Design attribute "interface"
    - Implement attribute parsing (without extra crate, probably?)
    - Implement actual derive logic
    - Implement codegen backend

### IDEAS:

- More complex field types
    - Arrays
    - Bytes? Or is just just an u8 array?
    - Signed int?

- No limit on max reg size?
    - YAML/Json limits -> Allow int & string in 'type value' fields?
    - What 'bigint' crate?
        - Probably rework convert/regmap + generators first?
        - Even needed? Just do everything as uint8 arrays?
    - Define maximum enum/field size?

- Input/processor option to stuff empty fields with reserved fields
- Input/processor option to stuff enums to allow full conversion

- C: Emit "UINT" version.

- GUI:
    - Tauri
    - Features/Tabs:
        - Graphical Editor/Viewer
        - Dump Decoder/Encoder
        - Remote Control
            - Connection options:
                - port to "bridge" process
                - via UART
                - via BLE


### NOT TODOs:

- Better syntax for bit ranges?
- Support more flexible register widths?
- Infer register/field width from underlying type?

- More complex field types
    - (( LE/BE Uints? Needed? ))
    - (( LE/BE Enums? Needed? ))

### RUST API NOTES:

bitfield-struct:

```rust
#[bitfield(u64)]
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)] // <- Attributes after `bitfield` are carried over
struct MyBitfield {
    /// Defaults to 16 bits for u16
    int: u16,
    /// Interpreted as 1 bit flag, with a custom default value
    #[bits(default = true)]
    flag: bool,
    /// Custom bit size
    #[bits(1)]
    tiny: u8,
    /// Sign extend for signed integers
    #[bits(13)]
    negative: i16,
    /// Supports any type with `into_bits`/`from_bits` functions
    #[bits(16)]
    custom: CustomEnum,
    /// Public field -> public accessor functions
    #[bits(10)]
    pub public: usize,
    /// Also supports read-only fields
    #[bits(1, access = RO)]
    read_only: bool,
    /// And write-only fields
    #[bits(1, access = WO)]
    write_only: bool,
    /// Padding
    #[bits(5)]
    __: u8,
}

let raw: u64 = val.into();
```

# Packed structs libs:

### Packed Struct:
    - https://docs.rs/packed_struct/latest/packed_struct/
    - Strange API? What does read/write only do?

### Bitfield struct:
    - https://crates.io/crates/bitfield-struct

### Reginald features:
    - Support both big-endian and little-endian serialisation on the same struct.
    - Always-write is zero-size/zero overhead
    - Support also byte array extraction
    - Support non-try unpacking
    - YAML/autogen support.

    - CONSIDER:
        - Look at packed-structs msb0/lsb0 capabilites? Specify bit order? Specify ÓÅï
